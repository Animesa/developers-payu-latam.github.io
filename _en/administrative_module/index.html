<p>The administrative module is the system with which you can securely manage your PayU Latam account. With it, you can change your password, obtain the sales reports, find the data needed to integrate your website with our platform, use tools to receive payments even if you do not have a website, or even transfer money to your bank account.</p>
<div class="note4">To use the Administrative Module go <a href="http://www.payulatam.com/" target="_blank">www.payulatam.com</a>. At the top, you will find the <span class="highlight-txt2">“Login to Your Account”</span>, field. There you can enter your respective username and password, which will have been supplied via email at the time of creation of your PayU account.</div>
<div class="note5">You still do not have a PayU account?  You can create yours <a href="https://secure.payulatam.com/online_account/create_account.zul" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
