&nbsp;<br>
With these reports you can see the overview of the sales made through your PayU account and know the status of each of them (if they are in process, paid or refunded). 
An order can have several associated transactions. PayU stores payment attempts related to an order. For example if you sell your shoes to a client and he tries to pay with an invalid VISA credit card, he can then pay again with a MasterCard credit card. Each payment attempt is recorded in the order as a separate transaction.
