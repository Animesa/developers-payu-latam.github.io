<span class="blue-text-16">Through the "cash charges" module you can generate <span style="color: #009cdd;">payment coupons</span>. These coupons contain the necessary information for your customers to make cash payments as many times as they need at available payment points.</span><br><br>
<span class="grey-text-13">This solution is useful for businesses that need to make collections on a regular basis; for example paying memberships, courses, memberships or catalog and telesales, and more.</span><br><br>
<span class="grey-text-13">You can receive payments without any technical knowledge. You just have to send an email in which your client downloads the coupon and makes the respective payment.</span></div>
